        Theme nights might seem like another way of singing covers, and singing covers
        might not be as glamorous as singing your own songs, but
        many high-profile singers and entertainers actually sing songs they hadn't written
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a look Diana Ross. Ain't no mountain high enough is a fantastic song. However, it was
        written by a songwriting husband-and-wife duo by the name of Ashford &amp; Simpson.
        And what about Rihanna's "Diamond". That was written partly by the now well known Sia.

        And we must take a look at mature
        music genres; classical and jazz. There are new musicians and singers performing classics,
        sometimes to compositions that are hundreds of years old.
        Year-in and year-out, jazz and classical numbers are performed
        to audiences happy to see talented singing
        and musicianship play their favourite songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So don't be put off by the idea of singing covers. For many professional singers, performing
        covers is a great way of having a professional music career.
      </p>
      <h3>Do you prefer songwriting?</h3>
      <p>
        If you prefer songwriting, that's great. Carol has had the opportunity to songwrite over the years
        and still remain low-key. If you want to make a living singing your own songs, then
        doing theme nights may be considered a distraction to what you want to do. However, there are many

        >bands and singers</a>
        who got their start doing covers of other people's music.
      </p>
      <h3>Theme nights are easier than being a tribute act...</h3>
      <p>
        That's because you have to convincingly portray and sing exactly like the act, and audiences
        are very good a picking holes into your performance when you are directly being compared to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, creating a theme night can be as broad or as specific as you like. Carol normally goes in as a
        soul singer, and she gets to perform Motown, Soul Grooves, Disco, R&amp;B and stomping dance tracks from the late
        80's onwards. By being broad, she can then tailor her song selection to the audience. Others might go with something
        more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just because you won't have the burden of emulating the singer or performer,
        you still have to sing and perform well.
      </p>
      <h3>So what's the next step you can take?</h3>
      <p>
        Come up with a theme night. It doesn't have to be a music genre like soul, or rock; it can be
        anything you think an audience would be into. Decades and eras seem popular; like a 90s throwback night or
        swinging 60s. You might just want to do love songs for couples of boy band material if there are a group
        of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, you must be comfortable singing the theme.
        There's no point in doing Goth if it scares you. Remember, people have mobile phones and videos,
        so don't perform anything that you're not comfotable with.
      </p>
      <p>Put together two 45-minute sets. That could anything from 9-20 songs per set.</p>
      <p>
        Now you don't have to learn all those songs before you start promoting your theme night to a
        non-traditional music venue eg. bar, pub which puts on odd music nights here and there.
        You do have to be confident to sing or play all the songs on the set list well. You want to guage how interested
        music venue entertainment managers are into your idea. Once they're willing to try you out.
      </p>
      <p>However, your work has only just begun.</p>
