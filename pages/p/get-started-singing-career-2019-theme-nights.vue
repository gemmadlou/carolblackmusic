      With so many digital platforms for music, a theme night isn't the most
      attractive option for launching a singing career. But here's why you should
      consider it.

        It's 2019, and while MySpace still exists, there are so many other platforms to try to
        promote yourself and your music. You're probably on one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Youtube</li>
        <li>TikTok</li>
        <li>Bandcamp</li>
        <li>Soundcloud</li>
        <li>Twitter</li>
        <li>Audiomack</li>
        <li>Facebook</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm no expert in any of them and neither is Carol, so feel free to continue or
        start using those platforms and get advice from those who've made a success of them.
        Besides, there are probably a dozen more major platforms and hundreds more smaller ones.
        However, theme nights are a great way to get your voice out to people who aren't behind
        a screen; people who'll give you instant feedback with how they respond directly to your
        performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Don't be put off by theme nights</h3>
      <p>
        Theme nights might seem like another way of singing covers, and singing covers
        don't seem as glamorous as singing your own songs, but
        many high-profile singers and entertainers actually sing songs they hadn't written
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at Diana Ross. Ain't no mountain high enough is a fantastic song. However, it was
        written by a songwriting husband-and-wife duo by the name of Ashford &amp; Simpson.
        And what about Rihanna's "Diamond". That was written partly by the now well known Sia.
      </p>
      <p>
        And we must also take a look at mature
        music genres; classical and jazz. There are new musicians and singers performing classics,
        sometimes to compositions that are hundreds of years old.
        Year-in and year-out, jazz and classical numbers are performed
        to audiences happy to see talented singing
        and musicianship play their favourite songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So don't be put off by the idea of singing covers. For many professional singers, performing
        covers is the backbone of their professional music career.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting paid</h3>

      <p>
        Clearly, one of the hardest things for many is getting paid for their passion. And singing
        seems like one of those things few can earn a living from. But that doesn't have to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine an up-and-coming R&B artist who's got a few hundred subscribers on Youtube. Instead
        of waiting for more subscribers or trying to sell Â£0.99 songs on Amazon, they could create a
        theme night and sell that instead to non-music venues like cafes and bars, or to parties and
        festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get paid quite well for singing at a theme night. And even more so, if you are a good
        performer, referrals might bring you the opportunity of singing at other events. You never
        know who is in the audience.
      </p>
      <h3>Theme nights are easier than being a tribute act...</h3>
      <p>
        That's because you have to convincingly portray and sing exactly like the act, and audiences
        are very good a picking holes into your performance when you are directly being compared to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, creating a theme night can be as broad or as specific as you like. Carol normally goes in as a
        soul singer, and she gets to perform Motown, Soul Grooves, Disco, R&amp;B and stomping dance tracks from the late
        '80s onwards. By being broad, she can then tailor her song selection to the audience. Others might go with something
        more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just because you won't have the burden of emulating the singer or performer,
        you still have to sing and perform well.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you prefer songwriting?</h3>
      <p>
        If you prefer songwriting, that's great. Carol has had the opportunity to songwrite over the years
        and still remain low-key. If you want to make a living singing your own songs, then
        doing theme nights may be considered a distraction to what you want to do. However, there are many
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/38rJrt2ZVRlXCzXCZbBGTlH/ten-huge-bands-who-started-out-as-tribute-or-covers-acts"
        >bands and singers</a>
        who got their start doing covers of other people's music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more so, you can slip in one or two of your own songs at these events, and use them as a platform
        to promote yourself as an artist, or your original music, whilst getting paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you're serious about performing live one day, why not get a head start in practising the art
        of entertainment with other people's songs. That way, you can focus on performing, rather than worrying
        about how your music is being received.
      </p>
      <h3>So what's the next step you can take?</h3>
      <p>
        Come up with a theme night. It doesn't have to be a music genre like soul or rock; it can be
        anything you think an audience would be into. Decades and eras seem popular; like a 90s throwback night or
        swinging 60s. You might just want to do love songs for couples or boy band material if you are part a group.
      </p>
      <p>Put together two 45-minute sets. That could anything from 9-20 songs per set.</p>
      <p>
        Now you don't have to learn all those songs before you start promoting your theme night.
        You do have to be confident to sing or play all the songs on the setlist well.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, your work has only just begun. Hope this article has inspired you to
        take practical steps in becoming a professional singer in 2019.
