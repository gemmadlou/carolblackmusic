        It's almost 2019, and there's a lot of advice on how to start singing professionally.
        Advice tends to take advantage of new technology:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Youtube</li>
        <li>TikTok</li>
        <li>Bandcamp</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But is there a human-to-human way, or are careers only made on the internet?
        If you don't have any original music yet, you can start singing covers and
        doing theme nights straight away!
      </p>

      <h3>Don't be put off</h3>
      <p>
        At first glance, singing covers or doing a theme night may not seem glamorous, but
        many high-profile singers and entertainers actually sing songs they hadn't written
        themselves, and that doesn't stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at Diana Ross. Ain't no mountain high enough is a fantastic song. However, it was
        written by a songwriting husband-and-wife duo by the name of Ashford &amp; Simpson.
        And what about Rihanna's "Diamond". That was written partly by the now well known Sia.
      </p>
      <p>
        And we must also take a look at mature
        music genres; classical and jazz. There are new musicians and singers performing classics,
        sometimes to compositions that are hundreds of years old.
        Year-in and year-out, jazz and classical numbers are performed
        to audiences happy to see talented singing
        and musicianship play their favourite songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So don't be put off by the idea of singing covers. For many professional singers, performing
        covers is the backbone of their professional music career.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting paid</h3>

      <p>
        Clearly, one of the hardest things for many is getting paid for their passion. And singing
        seems like one of those things few can earn a living from. But that doesn't have to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine an up-and-coming R&B artist who's got a few hundred subscribers on Youtube. Instead
        of waiting for more subscribers or trying to sell Â£0.99 songs on Amazon, they could create a
        theme night and sell that instead to non-music venues like cafes and bars, or to parties and
        festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get paid quite well for singing at a theme night. And even more so, if you are a good
        performer, referrals might bring you the opportunity of singing at other events. You never
        know who is in the audience.
      </p>
      <h3>Theme nights are easier than being a tribute act...</h3>
      <p>
        That's because you have to convincingly portray and sing exactly like the act, and audiences
        are very good a picking holes into your performance when you are directly being compared to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, creating a theme night can be as broad or as specific as you like. Carol normally goes in as a
        soul singer, and she gets to perform Motown, Soul Grooves, Disco, R&amp;B and stomping dance tracks from the late
        '80s onwards. By being broad, she can then tailor her song selection to the audience. Others might go with something
        more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just because you won't have the burden of emulating the singer or performer,
        you still have to sing and perform well.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you prefer songwriting?</h3>
      <p>
        If you prefer songwriting, that's great. Carol has had the opportunity to songwrite over the years
        and still remain low-key. If you want to make a living singing your own songs, then
        doing theme nights may be considered a distraction to what you want to do. However, there are many
        <a

          href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/38rJrt2ZVRlXCzXCZbBGTlH/ten-huge-bands-who-started-out-as-tribute-or-covers-acts"
        >bands and singers</a>
        who got their start doing covers of other people's music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more so, you can slip in one or two of your own songs at these events, and use them as a platform
        to promote yourself as an artist, or your original music, whilst getting paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you're serious about performing live one day, why not get a head start in practising the art
        of entertainment with other people's songs. That way, you can focus on performing, rather than worrying
        about how your music is being received.
      </p>
      <h3>So what's the next step you can take?</h3>
      <p>
        Come up with a theme night. It doesn't have to be a music genre like soul or rock; it can be
        anything you think an audience would be into. Decades and eras seem popular; like a 90s throwback night or
        swinging 60s. You might just want to do love songs for couples or boy band material if you are part a group.
